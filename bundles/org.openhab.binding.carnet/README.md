# CarNet Binding

This binding integrates the CarNet service provided by Audi, Volkswagen and other brands.
It provides access to status information and control functions for compatible vehicles, which have activated the service.
The API provides a lot of diagnostic data and provide access to remote control functions like lock/unlock door.

## Discovery

The binding supports automated discovery of vehicles.
For now only Audi is supported, other brand might follow in the future, because the API has a big overlap between various brands.
The CarNet Account Thing has to be added manually giving the necessary credentials.
Once the account is online the binding can query all registered vehicles and creates a vehicle thing for each of them.

## Binding Configuration

The binding itself has no configuration options

## Supported Things

### CarNet Account (myaudi, volkswagen, skoda)

The Account thing implements the online connect to the CarNet service.
The binding supports myAudi (myaudi) and Skoda Connect (skoda).
Depending on brand, car model and activated license a different set of channels and actions are supported,

An account is required to setup the connection (register on the manufacture's portal, e.g. myAudi.de).
Usually the manufacturer supports to register a single or multiple vehicles under this account (identified by their unique vehicle identification number - VIN).
Once the account gets online the binding retrieves the complete vehicle list and creates a thing per vehicle.

### Vehicle (vehicle)

The thing type vehicle represents a registered vehicle.
The vehicle is associated with an account and an online connection is required to access the service.
The vehicle is identified by the unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).

The API provides a large number of vehicle data items.
The binding wraps those to channels in different groups.

Important: You have to enabled the Car Connect services and also give your consent in the MMI system. Use the code on your key holder to setup Car Connect services.

Please note:
Available channels depend on the specific vehicle type and equipment.
Most of them will be created dynamically depending on availability of the CarNet services.
On startup the binding detects the available API services and deactives them if the API responds with a 403 status (don't worry if you see those messages in the log).

Even if the car has a climater it might be that the service is not accessible and the channels will not be created if the car doesn't have a pre-heating system. This also applies to the trip data and destination history. The dependency on a pre-heating system is not obvious, but it has been verified by several users.

Thing initialization might take up to 1 minute depending on the amount of available data and API performance.
Sometimes the API has higher response times (or even times out).
The binding does a frequent recovery check (on each poll cycle) and re-connects to the API service if neccesary.

Values can be 1..5 or 0 to disable this history.
This creates a channel group per entry, e.g. destination1, destination2, destination3, rluHistory1, rluHistory2 etc.
The newest entry will be in xxx1 channel group.

The following channels are available depending on the vehicle type:
